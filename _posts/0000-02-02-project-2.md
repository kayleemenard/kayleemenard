goal: "Redesigned the packaging for Mr. Potato Head packaging. Suprisingly, never in the history of Mr. Potato Head has the famous toy been sold in a potato sack, so I took the opportunity to create something novel and evironmentally concious. In addition to the package, I designed some collectible cards depicting the original Funny Face characters to celebrate Mr. Potato Head's upcoming 75th anniversary."
