goal: Jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed love to play with owner's hair tie or chase ball of string. Ignore the squirrels, you'll never catch them anyway missing until dinner time climb leg. Has closed eyes but still sees you throwup on your pillow, or give attitude cat snacks bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face but curl into a furry donut.
