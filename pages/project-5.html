					<p class="giga">Winter 2014</p>
					<p><b>Goal:</b> Represent the multiple faces of Steam Whistle in a design to be used on t-shirts.</p>
					<p><b>How:</b> Being a canadian brewery with several green initiatives, I wanted to create something that expressed old school canadiana that beer drinkers any where would be happy to wear.<br>I set off sketching a design that would include elements familar to Steam Whistle and convey their easy-going attitude. Imitating the story of the Saint Bernard dogs clad with a barrels of brandy around their necks, who were charged with guiding and rescuing travelers through the alps, I chose a distinct face of climate change in Canada, the Polar Bear, to carry casks of beer through the canadian wilderness and down railways to canucks in need of beer.  The casks were designed after Steam Whistle's existing casks of beer. And keeping the company's history in mind, I included a raleway.<br>The colour palette uses tints of Steam Whistles brand colours: blue and green. I opted for a more illustrative look by using a pencil style brush to do all the outlines.</p>
