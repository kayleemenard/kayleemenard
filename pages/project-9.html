					<p><b>Goal:</b> Create a flat, graphic illustration that uses patterns as fill to create interest and contrast with the end goal of applying it to various print mediums.</p>
					<p><b>How:</b> It started with a muse/an image I found online, from which I drew an outline on tracing paper to then put a full composition together. The pencil outline was then scanned and retraced in Illustrator.
					<br>I sketched several different patterns and sequences, but refined my choice down to the selected five, then, once digitally refined, they were added to my pattern palette in Illustrator. The colour palette I used for the final version of the illustration needed to accomadate the quantity of colour needed to create contrast with the triangular pattern, and a slight pop of blue to break up the monotonous look of the overall piece.</p>
					<p><b>Afterthoughts: </b>I'm finding myself trying to balance time and efficiency against making the cleanest possible file. I'm slowly learning what doesn't always need to be refined or <i>expanded</i> can remain that way, leaving me time to focus on elements that really need to be corrected or simplified.</p>
