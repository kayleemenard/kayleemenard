					<p class="giga">Winter 2014</p>
					<p><b>Goal:</b> Redesign a book cover with typographic design</p>
					<p><b>How:</b> After selecting a book cover I had randomly found online, I began to explore themes related to the content. I wanted to create a fun cover that reflected the content and found inspiration in old gossiping scenes of tea time.
					<br>First and foremost the focus had to be on the typography of the title. I was inspired by Marian Bantjes handmade typography from sugar, which was perfect for my tea party theme. I played with a pile of sugar until it looked as I planned it to, and then uploaded it to Adobe Lightroom to make slight adjustments and hide out-of-place grains of sugar. I had also taken photos, albeit poorly lite, of a lipstick stained tea cup and <i>not-really-sugar</i> packets which were later composited into the new book cover as secondary elements that added context and a small pop of colour.</p>
