					<p class="giga">Winter 2014</p>
					<p><b>Goal:</b> Creat an illustration of a Canadian Figure in the style of Pablo Lobato, to be used later on as part of an illustrative packaging design.</p>
					<p><b>How:</b> After analyzing Pablo Lobato's style and using the basic principles of Gestalt, I set about illustrating Celia Franca, an important Canadian figure that greatly influenced ballet in Canada, in his style. Once the sketches had been finalized, it was imported into illustrator where it was carefully traced and improved. The colour palette was limited to three Pantone solid-coated colours and their tints to emphasize simplicity. <br>Once the illustration was complete, I was tasked with applying it to a relevant product package, in this case: pantyhose, while keeping with the original package's design.</p>
					<p><b>In Hindsight:</b> It was a welcome challenge to try to find and match the typefaces on my package design to the original's. However, if I were to revisit this project, I would try to improve the smoke in the illustration to better complement the sharp lines and geometry of the figure.</p>
