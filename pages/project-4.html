					<p><b>Goal:</b> Illustrate the modern <i>Crazy Cat Lady</i> in the style of the Art Nouveau artist, Aubrey Beardsley.</p>
					<p><b>How:</b> Aubrey Beardsley (1872-1898) was an illustrator during the art nouveau periode and was mostly know for his relatively offensive and caricature-like drawings of the bougeois at the time. Keeping his style and subjects in mind, I decided to illustrate the very well know cat enthusiast. <br>Starting with collecting images of art nouveau elements (wallpaper, fashion, architecture, room design...), I began composing. Several pencil on paper versions were done until proper negative space, line width, and patterns were defined. The illustration was then brought into Illustrator to be traced and filled.</p>
					<p><b>Looking back:</b> This was one of the first illustrations I had done digitally, and as such, I used my very limited skills at the time to create it. Over a year later, I wanted to tweak a small detail and realized that I could greatly improve on what was original done and I decided to clean up the file... seriously clean up the file. Although the final result was unaltered, I do feel pride knowing that the file is now better organized and quicker to load and much easier to edit, if need be, in the future.</p>
