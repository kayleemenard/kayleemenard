					<p><b>Goal:</b> Illustrate the modern <i>Crazy Cat Lady</i> in the style of the Art Nouveau artist, Aubrey Beardsley.</p>
					<p><b>Solution:</b> Aubrey Beardsley (1872-1898) was an illustrator during the art nouveau periode and was mostly know for his relatively offensive and caricature-like drawings of the bougeois at the time. Keeping his style and subjects in mind, I decided to illustrate the very well know cat enthusiast. <br>Starting with collecting images of art nouveau elements (wallpaper, fashion, architecture, room design...), I began composing. Several pencil on paper versions were done until proper negative space, line width, and patterns were defined. The illustration was then brought into Illustrator to be traced and filled.</p>
					<p><b>Side Note:</b> The below development images show a before and after image of the illustration. The <i>before</i> image was how I had originally created the file when I had limited Illustrator experience. The <i>after</i> image was taken a year later when realized I then had enough skills to clean it up, remove redundancies, and make it, overall, a more efficient digital file.</p>
