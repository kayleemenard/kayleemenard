					<h1 class="push-0">Android App Design using Material Design Principles</h1>
					<p class="giga">Fall 2015</p>
					<p><b>Goal:</b> Design a Stress Management app that works with wearable technology based on provided research and context from a colleague. The app was to be developped for Android using Google's Material Design principles. </p>
					<p><b>How:</b> From the information I was provided, I refined the definition of the app and decided to design an app that would respond to notifications provided by wearable technology of when the users stress levels are suddenly elevated from the norm. Once the wearable detects a spike, it prompt the user to complete a journal entry that describes the perceived severity of the stressful event, the people involved, where the user was when it occurred, etc. so that after several entries, the user can begin to view potential patterns that occur during the day, week, and month.
					<br>I wanted to keep the app as simple and un-demanding as possible. The main features were the journalling, and viewing the history of journal entries. I developped a rough prototype and used InVision to create an interactive mock-up to allow for user testing.
					<br>Results from the user testing helped me to remove unnesseccary elements, and clarify others, thus allowing me to progress onto a high fidelity prototype that respects the Material Design outline.</p>
