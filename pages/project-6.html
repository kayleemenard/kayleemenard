					<p class="giga">Fall 2014</p>
					<p><b>Goal:</b> I was challenged to create a bilingual booklet design for a past Cirque de Soleil annual report that treated the English and French sections equally.</p>
					<p><b>How:</b> I determined that I would design for a small format, coil bound book for simplicity, and allow for lots of white space around the text to make it look less demanding or taxing to the reader. I challenged myself to not use any photography.
					<br>I decided early on that rather than have both languages fighting for dominance either on the same page or on facing pages, they would each have a half of the booklet: each with an outter cover, one side upside-down at a time, and separated by a couple lined papers for notes at the center of the booklet.
					<br>I went with light and colourful experience that used, mostly drawing colours and inspiration from the Varekai Cirque de Soleil show. I painted some abstract watercolours and edited the colours in photoshop to guarantee that they would match the theme. Sample of the watercolour were used as section page headers and slim margin decorations.</p>
					<p><b>Results:</b> Printing the 64 page booklet wass a lesson in proper page layout for print, and working alongside the printer operator to make sure that the booklet would print properly: one side upright, the other upside-down.</p>
