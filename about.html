banner-txt: I currently live in Ottawa, and would love to live in Montreal again sometime soon. I'm a storyteller and illustrator that also likes research, web design and development, print media and making quilts that never get finished. <br><br> I firmly believe that everyone can draw, that being said, it's okay to ask for help, especially when it comes to trying to communicate what you want to say to the world. My goal is to help cool people communicate their message, look, and experience clearly, visually and aesthetically to the world.
